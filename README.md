# Welcome, I'm DragonWF!

### Description:
- Hello! I'm a **senior high school student** and a **self-taught programmer**.
- I plan on getting **BSIT** in college and that's also why I've been going on a training arc recently to become better at programming.
- The programming and markup languages I mainly code in are **Python**, **C#**, **SQL**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
