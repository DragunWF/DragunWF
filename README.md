# Welcome, I'm DragonWF!

### Description:
- Hello! I'm a senior high school student and a self-taught programmer with only 3 months of experience so don't expect much from me yet. :thumbsup:
- I plan on getting BSIT in college and that's also why I've been going on a training arc recently to become better at programming. :mortar_board:
