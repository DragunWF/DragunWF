# Welcome, I'm DragonWF!

### Description:
- Hello! I'm a **senior high school student** and a **self-taught programmer** with only 7 months of experience so don't expect much from me yet.
- I plan on getting **BSIT** in college and that's also why I've been going on a training arc recently to become better at programming.
- The coding languages I know fair enough are **Python**, **SQL**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
