# Welcome, I'm DragonWF!

### Description:
- Hello! I'm a **senior high school student** and a **self-taught programmer** with only 5 months of experience so don't expect much from me yet.
- The coding languages I know are **Python**, **SQL**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
- I plan on getting **BSIT** in college and that's also why I've been going on a training arc recently to become better at programming.
- If you want to look at my recent code, I'd recommend taking a look at my most recent project, [Ancalagon](https://github.com/DragunWF/Ancalagon). My other
  projects code is quite old and bad, my most recent one shows how I code nowadays (Which of course, **still needs some improvement**).
